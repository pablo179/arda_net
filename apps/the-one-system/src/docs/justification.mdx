## Why is this documentation like this?

The one system is a design system created by (me)[github.com] to help me as study and practice my skills as developer and
help me to create a better, fast and more consistent design for my projects.
That means is not intended to be formal and company oriented, but more like a personal project.
You will find a lot of references to the Lord of the Rings and other fantasy books, because of the inspiration
that helped me to came with the idea of the one system and the name itself.

## Target

The target of this documentation is to help me to remember the decisions and the rules that I created for the one system. However
if you find this documentation useful, you are welcome to use it as a reference for your projects. I personally recommend it
for enthusiasts developers who are looking for a simple and easy to use design system to create their projects or design systems.
